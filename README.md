# ArcoLinuxIso Carli

To be able to build you install this package

Build your iso by running script 30 or 40 in the folder
installation scripts.

Archiso will be installed if not present.
Carli keys will be installed if not present.
Carli mirrors will be installed if not present.

Do check out the archiso.readme. There may be a difference between archiso 
versions. That may lead to different results.

Use the correct version of archiso.

Change the files - packages.x86_64 being the most important.
